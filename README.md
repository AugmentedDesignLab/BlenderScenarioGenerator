# BlenderScenarioGenerator
Generate roads and scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles in simulation using Blender python scripting. Output will be an OpenDRIVE file, an OpenSCENARIO file and an FBX file. All three of these formats can be imported into autonomous vehicle simulators such as CARLA. 

## Getting started
* First, [download and install Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/). This is a 3D modeling tool. It has a [Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_overview.html). This repository contains python scripts that make use of this API for generating roads.
* Add the [Blender installation directory](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/launch/index.html) to the environment variable such that the command *blender* can be accessed from the command line. [Here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/launch/macos.html) are the instructions for doing so on MacOS and [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/launch/windows.html) are the instructions for doing so on Windows. 
* Clone this repository and change directory to it. 
* Run the python script *road_base.py* using the **Blender python only**. This will *register* the *pr* (procedural roads) set of operations. The command for this would be **blender --python road_base.py**.
* Run from the Blender python console, *bpy.ops.pr.road()*. This should generate a road in the 3D viewport.
* For further code editing, you can open the python script on Blender's text editor and click play for running the script.

## Features to be implemented
- [] Junction creation capability: straight and curved roads, multiple incoming roads.
- [] OpenDRIVE export capability.
- [] Operator for procedurally generating buildings
- [] Operator for procedurally placing tree assets
